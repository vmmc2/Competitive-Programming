## Useful Notes:
* To convert a int to a string, use the function ```to_string(int)``` from the ```<string>``` library.
* To split a string using blank spaces as the delimeters, use stringstream from the ```<sstream>``` library.
* To convert a string to a int, use the function ```stoi(string)``` from the ```<string>``` library.
* Split a string into words using a specific delimiter:
```c++
        stringstream ss(s);
        string word;
        string delimiter = " ";
        while(getline(ss, word, delimiter)){
            words.push_back(word);
        }
