# Notes about these problems.

## Symmetric Tree
* In this problem there are two corner cases: the first one is when we receive an empty binary tree. The second one is when we receive a binary tree with just one element. Both cases are easy to handle with if-statements. The general case must be treated by using a helper() function that will receive as parameters: root->left and root->right.
